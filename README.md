# Multivariate generalised linear models for otolith chemistry and shape in R

## This code and data accompanies Khan & Schilling *et al* (In Press)

By running this code, multivariate generalised linear models are run on otolith shape and otolith chemistry data separately and together. 
This code:
* Checks assumptions
* Runs MGLMs including pairwise comparisons
* Creates ordination plots (via the boral package)

The Code folder contains all the code needed to run the analyses, this can be adapted for other datasets.

The Data folder contains the data which is called by the Code folder.

The ShapeAnalysis folder contains the otolith images and data needed to extract the shape coefficients.

The binder link below will create an R environment online where the analysis can be replicated. NOTE THIS WILL BE VERY SLOW TO START!
